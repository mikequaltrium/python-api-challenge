# observable trends based on the data
* The majority of cities with High Tropical temperatures is concentrated heavily between the latitudes of -20 and 20 near the equator. Temperate zones with moderate weather are found further north between the latitudes of 40 and 60 and south between the latitudes of -20 and 50. The highest temperatures logged where mostly between 80 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest temperatures where between 0 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit. 

* The warmer tropical zones tend to have a dryer climate with less than 80% Humidity

* Warmer zones near the equator also tend to have less wind (less than 20 mph) while colder climates have greater wind speeds (up to 37mph) 

* Cloudiness does not demonstrate any apparent trends based on latitude.
